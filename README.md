# Lattice60 Keyboard Repository
This repository contains the files needed to reproduce the Lattice60, an ortholinear keyboard that can be built with off-the-shelf keycaps. The case and plate are 3D printed while the switch matrix is handwired. A Sparkfun Pro Micro hosts the QMK firmware. For an in-depth build guide, please refer to my [blog](https://hackaday.io/project/185358-lattice60) on Hackaday.

## Repo Structure
Use tag `lattice60` to checkout the "release" version of all the files.

* The 3D model files can be found in `<repo_root>/model_files`
